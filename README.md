# Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis Classification using Twitter Sentiment140 Dataset 

In this project,we implement two classiﬁers based on a logistic regression model to decide whether the sentiment in a tweet is positive or negative. The methods applied in this paper constitute of (i) converting the textual data to a numeric form using Term Frequency (TF) hashing to generate feature vectors and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to scale the feature vector to reduce the weights of words that appear often in tweets and not affect the sentiment classiﬁcation (ii) tokenizing the textual data into consecutive sequences of words, called n-grams, and then ﬁtting the features (extracted and scaled the same way as described in (i) and then assembled together) from the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams into a logistic regression model. We compare the computational performance and accuracy on validation and test sets for each method.
